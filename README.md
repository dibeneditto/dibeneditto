My objective is to work on challenging research problems of both scientific and practical importance, where my team's results provide novel approaches and unprecedented results. I excel in realâ€“world rapid physical prototyping to solve complex engineering challenges. When you need something that works as soon as possible, I will find a way. Presently, I am a Researchâ€“Option Masters in Science graduate student in Biomedical Engineering (BME) at Carnegie Mellon University and a Bioengineered Organs Initiative Researcher for principal investigator Dr. Keith Cook, Professor and BME Department Head. My current research is focused on supplemental artificial bioengineered organs to prevent and alleviate human suffering from organ failure caused by disease, trauma, or combat injury. I have a background in computer programming, destructive testing, iterative mechanical design, project management, psychology, public speaking, rapid prototyping, research methods, statistical analysis, and systems architecture.
